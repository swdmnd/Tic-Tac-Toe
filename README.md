# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is my final laboratorium project in Praktikum Dasar Komputer dan Pemrograman. I worked with my friend who wrote the report for it.

Hargailah yang membuat program dengan tidak mengambil contoh source code tanpa referensi.

Gambar O dan X diambil dari google. gambar foo dan hello diambil dari lazyfoo.net. sisanya buatan sendiri.

======Font Copyright on FAQ======

Can I use Lazy Font?
A: Yes, under 3 conditions.

The conditions go as follows:
1) The font must be used in a game, either by using the font to render text or in a graphic in the game.
2) You must not sell your game for profit if it uses the font.
3) You must acknowledge Lazy Foo' Productions' copyright to the font. The acknowledgement can be either with in the actual game itself or in a text file distrubted with the game.

I am claiming copyright on Lazy Font in the unlikely case somebody actually makes money off of it. I understand it's hard to find fonts when you're starting out, so you newbies can use my font for your games under the above conditions.
